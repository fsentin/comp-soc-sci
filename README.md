Social network analysis has emerged as a vital tool for understanding human interactions in various contexts, offering valuable insights into the structural and dynamic patterns of relationships. It has been applied to explore phenomena like information diffusion, community formation, and opinion polarization. One domain where social network analysis holds potential is the healthcare sector, where interpersonal connections play an important role in patient care,
organizational dynamics, and the overall well-being of the healthcare organization. Thus, this work focuses on the analysis of a temporal social network collected within a hospital setting.
